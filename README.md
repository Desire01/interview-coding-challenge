Backend (Server-side)

1) Created a Popular movies controller that sends a get request to TMDB to return the popular movies
2) Created a Search movies controller that sends a get request to TMDB to return the searched movies 
3) Enabled CORS to allow resource sharing and allowing the frontend to get data from the backend
4) Added SwaggerUI for the documenting of the api
5) Used HttpclientFactory to create a new client and send requests to the api 
6) Implemented Dependancy Injection in the popular and Search movies controller

Frontend (Client-side)

1) Managed to load movies through the serverside endpoint (https://localhost:44325/api/popular)
2) For the search and details endpoints i could not figure out how to implement them on the serverside due to starting the challenge late and also lack of proper farmilarity with the languages used.
   Hence only managed to display results of the hardcoded search term from the server side while the details endpoint was done directly from the client-side without passing throughthe serverside API
3) Added React-Router
4) Used CSS for Styling  

Due to time I could not fully grasp on using typescript in the code cause I am not familiar with it yet. I had to use ReactJS because I have a bit of familiarity with it.
*NOTE* The Zipped file contains the original clientside skeleton made in typescript. Had to zip it to avoid any conflicts in the code   

Thank you
